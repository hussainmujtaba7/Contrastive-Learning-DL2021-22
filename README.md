# Contrastive-Learning-on-Point-Clouds-DL-2022-

In this project, I investigated the use of contrastive learning techniques on non-Euclidean data, specifically point clouds sampled from the ShapeNet10 dataset. I provided an overview of the main ideas and current state of the art contrastive learning techniques, and specifically used the SimCLRv2 technique in my experiments. I implemented this technique using en- coders such as PointNet++ and Dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN), and was able to learn meaningful representations. However, my results showed that the performance on downstream tasks, in this case classification, did not significantly improve as a result. I also experimented with various augmentations during contrastive learning and evaluated their impact on the encoders, but these did not lead to better performance. My results sug- gest that contrastive learning may not be as ef- fective for improving downstream tasks on non- Euclidean data like point clouds.
