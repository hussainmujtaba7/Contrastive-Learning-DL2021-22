# Contrastive-Learning-on-Point-Clouds-DL-2022-

In this project, I investigated the use of contrastive learning techniques on non-Euclidean data, specifically point clouds sampled from the ShapeNet10 dataset. I provided an overview of the main ideas and current state of the art  contrastive learning techniques, and specifically used the SimCLRv2 technique in my experiments. I implemented this technique using encoders such as PointNet++ and Dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN), and was able to learn meaningful representations. However, my results show that the performance on downstream tasks, in this case classification, did not significantly improve the result. I also experimented with various augmentations sets for contrastive learning and evaluated their impact on the downstream task.The experiments conducted suggest that the choice of augmentations, encoder architecture, and encoder size used while training significantly impact the results on downstream tasks,therefore further experiments with different sets of augmentations and size of encoders might be able to yield better results.
